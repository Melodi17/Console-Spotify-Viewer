### Getting Started

We will need to create a application first, to do this

- Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/

- Click log in and log into your Spotify account

- Click create an app

- Choose an app name and an app description

- Check the I agree checkbox and click create

- Then click edit settings

- Add https://localhost:8888/callback to the redirect urls and click add, then click save

- Copy your client id, you will need it for later

Download the app by going to https://github.com/Melodi17/Console-Spotify-Viewer/releases and selecting the latest one, then download the exe, and run it. It will ask for the client id you saved earlier, paste this and its ready to go.
